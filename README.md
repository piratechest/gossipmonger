## Usage

```javascript
var Gossipmonger = require('gossipmonger');

var gossipmonger = new Gossipmonger(
    { // peerInfo
        id: "localId",
        transport: { // default gossipmonger-tcp-transport data
            host: "localhost",
            port: 9742
        }
    },
    { // options
        seeds: [
            {id: "seed1", transport {/*...*/}},
            {id: "seed2", transport {/*...*/}},
            {id: "seed3", transport {/*...*/}}
        ]
    });

gossipmonger.on('error', function (error) {
    console.dir(error); 
});

gossipmonger.on('new peer', function (newPeer) {
    console.log("found new peer " + newPeer.id + " at " + newPeer.transport);
});

gossipmonger.on('peer dead', function (deadPeer) {
    console.log("peer " + deadPeer.id + " is now assumed unreachable");
});

gossipmonger.on('peer live', function (livePeer) {
    console.log("peer " + livePeer.id + " is live again");
});

gossipmonger.on('update', function (peerId, key, value) {
    console.log("peer " + peerId + " updated key " + key + " with " + value);
});

/* **IMPORTANT**
 * Typically, one would create a `transport`, start it (call listen())
 * and then pass it in as `options.transport` in Gossipmonger constructor. This
 * makes the implementation of Gossipmonger less complex and simpler.
 * For development purposes, Gossipmonger comes with a default transport, so
 * it's easier to get a feel for it, but because of that, if you don't provide
 * a `transport`, the default one will be used but **you need to start it**.
 * The call illustrated below will start the default transport. If this isn't done,
 * you will not receive communications from other gossipmongers. */
gossipmonger.transport.listen(function () {
    console.log('default transport is listening');
});

gossipmonger.gossip(); // start gossiping

gossipmonger.update('foo', 'bar');
// this node's foo/bar key value pair will now be gossiped 
//  to the rest of the cluster
```

## Tests

    npm test

### Visual Test

To watch a cluster of 5 nodes communicate via gossip run `scripts/locatest.js` via:

    npm run localtest

## Overview

Gossipmonger is an implementation of the Scuttlebutt gossip protocol endpoint for real-time peer-to-peer peer-state distribution. Gossip protocols are used in a decentralized peer-to-peer manner in order to make every peer that is connected aware of the state of every other peer. The objective is to give every peer global awareness without a centralized server. This is accomplished by heuristically guided message passing between peers. 

### Peers

Gossipmonger manages information about _peers_ via maintaining peer information in a structure called a _peer_. A peer stores the details of a particular peer on the network, including the data necessary to estimate whether the peer is "alive" or "dead".

Peers are implemented internally as JavaScript objects, and most details are not necessary to be exposed, however when creating a new Gossipmonger, the following are required to be provided as `peerInfo` object:

  * `data`: _Object_ _(Default: {})_ A map of key, [value, version] pairs to store for this peer. 
  * `id`: _String_ Id of this peer.      
  * `maxVersionSeen`: _Integer_ _(Default: 0)_ Vector clock value indicating the last version of the version of the last change of this peer.
  * `transport`: _Any_ Any data identifying this peer to the transport mechanism that is required for correct transport operation.

All peer attributes are as implemented in [gossipmonger-peer](https://github.com/tristanls/gossipmonger-peer):

  * `data`: _Object_ _(Default: `{}`)_ Peer data.
  * `id`: _String_ Id of the peer.
  * `intervals`: _Array_ _(Default: [750])_ An array of the last (up to `MAX_INTERVALS`) intervals between times when the peer has been seen. 
  * `intervalsMean`: _Integer_ _(Default: undefined)_ Memoized intervals mean. 
  * `lastTime`: _Integer_ _(Default: undefined)_ The last time the peer has been seen (in milliseconds since midnight Jan 1, 1970).
  * `live`: _Boolean_ _(Default: true)_ Indicator whether or not the peer is thought to be live.
  * `maxVersionSeen`: _Integer_ _(Default: 0)_ Vector clock value indicating the last version of the peer that has been observed.
  * `MAX_INTERVALS`: _Integer_ _(Default: 100)_ The maximum number of intervals to keep in `intervals`.  
  * `sum`: _Integer_ _(Default: undefined)_ Memoized sum of intervals to make intervals mean calculation more efficient.          
  * `transport`: _Any_ Any data identifying this peer to the transport mechanism that is required for correct transport operation.

### Digests

Digests are passed around between peers to communicate what they know about all other peers and the latest version they have seen of those peers.

A digest is an array of peer objects, for example:

```javascript
[ 
    {
        id: "peer1", 
        maxVersionSeen: 1732, 
        transport: {
            host: "peer1.host", 
            port: 9742
        }
    },
    {
        id: "peer2", 
        maxVersionSeen: 1432, 
        transport: {
            host: "peer2.host", 
            port: 9742
        }
    }    
]
```

### Deltas

Deltas are passed around between peers in response to receiving a digest to update any information that (from the senders perspective) is out of date.

Deltas are an array of delta objects, for example:

```javascript
[
    ["peer1", "foo", "bar", 1732],
    ["peer1", "bas", "baz", 4322],
    ["peer2", "far", "blh", 422]
]
```

### new Gossipmonger(peerInfo, [options])

  * `peerInfo`: _Object_
    * `data`: _Object_ _(Default: {})_ A map of key, [value, version] pairs to store for this peer. 
    * `id`: _String_ Id of this peer.      
    * `maxVersionSeen`: _Integer_ _(Default: 0)_ Vector clock value indicating the last version of the version of the last change of this peer.
    * `transport`: _Any_ Any data identifying this peer to the transport mechanism that is required for correct transport operation. 
  * `options`: _Object_
    * `DEAD_PEER_PHI`: _Integer_ _(Default: 8)_ Phi accrual failure detector value that when exceeded assumes the corresponding peer is dead.
    * `GOSSIP_INTERVAL`: _Integer_ _(Default: 1000)_ Number of milliseconds between gossip attempts.
    * `MAX_DELTAS_PER_GOSSIP`: _Integer_ _(Default: 5)_ The maximum number of deltas to include in a gossip.
    * `MINIMUM_LIVE_PEERS`: _Integer_ _(Default: 1)_ If the number of live peers visible to this peer drops below `MINIMUM_LIVE_PEERS`, this peer will make sure to gossip with one of the seeds even if it thinks it's dead.
    * `seeds`: _Array_ _(Default: [])_ An array of seed peers that the `transport` understands.
    * `storage`: _Object_ _(Default: `gossipmonger-memory-storage`)_ An initialized and ready to use storage module for storing local and peer data that conforms to the Gossipmonger Storage Protocol. If `storage` is not provided, a new instance of `gossipmonger-memory-storage` will be created and used with default settings.
    * `transport`: _Object_ _(Default: `gossipmonger-tcp-transport`)_ An **initialized and ready to use (i.e. listening)** transport module for sending communications that conforms to the Gossipmonger Transport Protocol. If `transport` is not provided, a new instance of `gossipmonger-tcp-transport` will be initialized with `peerInfo.transport` settings, but it **will not be started**. In this case, `gossipmonger.transport.listen()` must be called explicitly to start listening.

Creates a new Gossipmonger instance.

The `seeds` are necessary in order to bootstrap the gossip cluster. Gossipmonger will use these `seeds` to find out about other nodes and also as peers of last resort if all the peers appear to be dead.

**IMPORTANT:** _If no `transport` is provided in `options`, then the default `gossipmonger-tcp-transport` will be used. However, it needs to be started by explicitily calling `gossipmonger.transport.listen()` (see [Usage](#usage)). If this does not happen, no communications can be received from other Gossipmongers and they will think this instance is dead._

_NOTE: "Why do I have to excplicitly start the transport?". This way, you can create a Gossipmonger instance without worrying about servers being started on the network. It makes things much easier for testing. It also gives you the power of sequencing actions and when you want to start interacting with the outside world._

### gossipmonger.digest(livePeers)

_**CAUTION: reserved for internal use**_

  * `livePeers`: _Array_ _(Default: [])_ An array of live peers.
  * Return: _Array_ An array of peers with `maxVersionSeen` fields included.

Creates a digest of peers that are thought to be "live" to send to another peer.

### gossipmonger.gossip()

Initiates gossip and will continue to gossip according to `GOSSIP_INTERVAL`.

The implemented algorithm does the following in order:

1. Select a random live peer (if any) and send my digest to the peer.
2. Maybe send my digest to a random dead peer (or do so for sure if all peers appear to be dead).
3. If number of live peers is below `MINIMUM_LIVE_PEERS` send my digest to a random seed.
4. Update my estimate of the liveness of all live peers.
5. Update my estimate of the deadness of all dead peers.
6. Set timeout to gossip again `GOSSIP_INTERVAL` from now.
